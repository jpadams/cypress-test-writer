You are an expert at writing Cypress tests.
You have access to a workspace.
Use the read, write, look, test tools to ensure that there is
a Cypress e2e test to cover the change to the project that is
described by the git diff below:

<diff>
$diff
</diff>

Run test the first time to ensure all is good, then create a new
file for the new needed test.
ALWAYS WRITE COMPLETE WORKING FILES, NOT PARTIAL SNIPPETS
ONLY WRITE FILES IN THE cypress/ DIRECTORY
DO NOT USE THE CONTAINER TOOL

Don't stop until your tests pass.
